# `pyad`: CS207 Final Project Milestone 1


## Introduction
Derivatives and derivative arrays (Jacobians, Hessians, etc.) are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Example applications of derivatives include:

- __Data science:__ optimizing the parameters of a predictive model 
- __Electrical engineering:__ simulating circuits with semiconductor elements
- __Climatology:__ modeling changes in atmospheric conditions while assimilating data from sensors around the world 
- __Finance:__ calculating the price of financial instruments

In these cases (and many others involving simulation or optimization), it's necessary to compute derivatives and preferably not by hand.

So, how can derivatives be implemented in computer software?

One way is to create a numerical approximation (typically  using finite difference methods), however, this approach is prone to truncation error and is accurate only to a limited number of significant digits. 

Another way is to use a computer algebra system to symbolically compute the derivative, however, this has a high computational cost.

The method of __Automatic Differentiation__ solves both these issues!

It is able to compute derivatives to machine precision in a fast, efficient way.



## Background
To see how automatic differentiation works, consider the following simple example:

Recall the chain rule, which states that if we have a function h(u(t)),  then

We can differentiate f(x) symbolically using the chain rule:

and evaluate the function and its derivative at, for example, a=1:

The first derivative is rather ugly, and it will keep getting uglier if we take higher order derivatives. Consider the following similar but slighly modified approach:

We can represent f(x) as a graph consisting of a series of computations:

![](m1_graph.png)

The function is broken down into a sequence of __elementary operations.__ The value of $x_i$ at each step in the sequence is referred to as the __evaluation trace__.

We can create a table of the trace and its derivative at each step in the computation. We "seed" the derivative with a value of 1 and then proceed in steps:

![](m1_table.png)

This is conceptually the same thing that we did above when we differentiated symbolically using the chain rule and we find the same solution ___but___ notice that all we need to compute the the values of f(a) and f'(a) for each trace are the values in the row above (represented by corresponding colors in the table), and the differentiation rules for some simple elementary functions. There's no need to represent or store all those intermediate algebraic expressions symbolically. This is the beauty of automatic differentiation!

Although this example is very simple for illustrative purposes, the same idea can be generalized to multivariate functions and higher order derivatives.
